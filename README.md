  Hey Everyone, welcome to the Cycle and Flow GitHub. This app was created as an alternative way for people to recycle cans and bottles, earning money while doing so, without having to actually make the trip to the deposit site. The way the app works, customers subscribe to the app, and can make request for couriers to pickup recycle bottles and cans. The minimum amount of recyclables required for a request to be fulfilled is twenty-five. Once onsite, the courier will perform a manual count of the recyclables, update the application if there are any changes, then head to the deposit site. Once the cans are recycled, the customer will receive a notification, confirming the information is correct. Once confirmed, a percentage of the money will go to the customer, Cycle and Flow, and the courier.
